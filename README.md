Users are able to interact with the Alliance Gaming website in various ways. Users can navigate or access the website from any page through hyperlinks in the navigation bar or the footer. Users are able to scroll up and down on every page to view visual information and learn about different aspects of the company. Another key interaction on our website is the merchandise page. On the merch page, users can add to a cart, view products,  and make a purchase of desired company gear. 

Running the Alliance Gaming Website:

The user must first implement the merch_inventory database and merch relation in MySql using the included SQL file. Once that database and relation have been created, the user must bring all of the site files (HTML, PHP, CSS and Images) into their htdocs folder and put them all in the same folder. Make sure the images folder is included, and the images stay within that images folder. The user will then launch the XAMPP control panel and start MySql and Apache Web Server. The user can then access the website by typing localhost/fileNameInHtdocs/home.html, replacing fileNameInHtdocs with the name of the folder you placed all of the files in within the htdocs folder.From there, the homepage for Alliance Gaming will load, and the user can proceed to navigate the page using the nav bar and other hyperlinked buttons.
